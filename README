I needed an abstract layer to box2dweb to simplify the creation of objects. I intend to add the mouse/touch events part which is missing in boxbox (for my needs - I need it to create an html5 game). We'll see where it will lead me - at least, I'm learning box2dweb.

Demos/tests are in the demos/topheman folder
