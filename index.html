            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p><strong>boxbox events</strong> is a fork by <a href="https://github.com/topheman" title="@topheman">Christophe Rosset</a>, of the original version of boxbox, created by <a href="http://incompl.github.com/boxbox/">Greg Smith</a></p>
            <h2>What was in boxbox ?</h2>
            <p>An abstract layer to make the manipulation of objects in the <a href="http://box2d.org/" title="box2d">box2d</a> physics engine simplier, for game development.</p>
            <h2>What's more in boxbox events ?</h2>
            <p>A whole touch / mouse events management of the entities. Many types of events which would be complicated and take multiple lines of code are now included in the package.</p>
            <p class="warning">Warning : this framework is still under development. I will release a beta version in a few weeks.</p>
            <p>This site is also still at work.</p>
